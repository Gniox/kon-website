                        Ho-kago Tea Time (放課後ほうかごティータイムてぃいたいむ), often abbreviated as HTT, is the main band of the series K-ON!. The name translates into English as After-School Tea Time.

                    The five Sakuragaoka High School students Yui Hirasawa, Mio Akiyama, Ritsu Tainaka, Tsumugi Kotobuki and Azusa Nakano had already been members of their school's Light Music Club for a reasonably long time when the first questions about forming an independent band appeared. The idea was to gather together to play music while out of school. The only real problem was to find a name for the band. After endless and fruitless discussion, the club's adviser Sawako Yamanaka, irritated, gave the band its current name, Ho-kago Tea Time, which is an allusion to the main activities in the Light Music Club - gathering together to drink tea after school has ended. The members, although disappointed about not being able to decide the name on their own, accepted it willingly.[1]

                    For the next several concerts, rather than performing as the Light Music Club, they referred to themselves as Ho-kago Tea Time. Together, they experienced many events like visiting the "Natsu Rock Fest", performing alongside the band Death Devil or even in London at a "Japanese Culture Festival". As the third year of the four seniors came to an end however, the band had to split. While Azusa stayed behind to form her own band, Wakaba Girls, out of the new cast of the Light Music Club, the four seniors Yui, Mio, Ritsu and Tsumugi started to attend the J. Women's university where they continued Ho-kago Tea Time without Azusa. Eventually, the band joined the university's Light Music Club where they started a friendly rivalry with the band Onna Gumi.
