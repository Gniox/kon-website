# kon-website

My first website.  After going through W3School's HTML, CSS, and JS tutorials to familiarize myself with the languages, I used Web Dev Simplified first project proposal tutorial as a framework for this website, before venturing on my own.  I looked into animating a splash page and messed around with the css flex containers for adding sticky gifs to some of the pages, as well as creating an interactive home page.  The cart portions in the store.html and scripts.js I implemented on my own, which is why it is quite messy. 

Steps for Improvement:
UX/UI implementation beforehand
build with mobile browsers in mind as well as desktop browsing
work on how to manipulate layout
comment consistently
commit consistently
